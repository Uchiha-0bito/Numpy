# Introduction to NumPy

Welcome to the **Introduction to NumPy** repository! This repository provides a basic introduction to NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.

## What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library in Python for scientific computing. It provides support for:

- **Multidimensional Arrays**: Efficiently handle and operate on large datasets.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Perform a wide range of mathematical operations.
- **Linear Algebra**: Solve systems of linear equations and perform matrix operations.
- **Random Number Generation**: Generate random numbers and perform statistical analysis.

## Key Features

- **Array Creation**: Create and manipulate arrays with ease.
- **Array Operations**: Perform operations such as slicing, indexing, and reshaping.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Use built-in functions for mathematical computations.
- **Performance**: NumPy operations are optimized for performance and efficiency.

## Getting Started

To use NumPy, you need to have it installed. You can install NumPy via pip: 

```bash
pip install numpy
